She switched between philosophy, literature and journalism because she didn't fit any mold. She wrote with obsessive precision but also with a freedom that broke everything established. She read Artaud, Rimbaud, Baudelaire... she built herself from literature, even changing her own name. She was rebellious, eccentric, subversive against what was expected of her. Her letters are that constant dialogue with herself, with all that she was... as if she were programming her own identity, iterating until finding a version she could inhabit. That infinite search for the lost, that tension between rational precision and surrealist automatism... is what I feel when I create: searching for something I don't know if it exists but I need to find.",
